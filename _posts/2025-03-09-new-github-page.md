title: Switching Github Pages theme multiple years 
lead: Switching themes. Easy right?

After four years using another theme and the need to fix some stuff in my page, I thought 'Sure just fixing some links and icons shouldn't be a issue right?'. Oh boy was I wrong...

First issue I encountered was the site wouldn't build locally anymore. From my non-Ruby background I determined I need to upgrade my Ruby version. After this <code>bundle</code> behaved and I could deploy my site locally.

Second issue after that, my old theme used FontAwesome in a very old version, so some icons I wanted to use, just weren't available. So again, just updating FA should be just a couple of minutes downloading new versions and everything should run fine. But no, after several hours trying a few things my page just looked like a basic 'Hello world' site done without any CSS or JS. I guess if you know what you are doing and are font with HTML, CSS and JS and not like me who writes mostly Java you could have get it done.

So after wasting a few hours in 'Changing a few links and icons fast' I just decided to start from scratch with a new theme and just start from scratch.
